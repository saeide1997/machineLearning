# Machine Learning Drawing Recognition App
This is a JavaScript-based application that uses machine learning to recognize user-drawn images. Users can draw on the canvas, and the application predicts the object or shape using a trained machine learning model.

## Features
-**AI-Powered Recognition:** Leveraging a machine learning model to classify hand-drawn images.
-**Interactive User Experience:** Intuitive canvas interface for drawing.
-**Customizable Model:** Easily replace or update the ML model to improve prediction accuracy.
-**Real-Time Feedback:** Predictions are displayed immediately as the user draws.How It Works

The user sketches a shape, object, or symbol on the drawing canvas.
The application preprocesses the drawing and feeds it into the machine learning model.
The model analyzes the input and predicts the label with a confidence score.
The result is displayed to the user in real time.


## Technologies Used
•**JavaScript:** For application logic and integration.
•**HTML5 Canvas:** To create an interactive drawing area.
•**TensorFlow.js (or similar):** For deploying and running the ML model directly in the browser.
•**CSS:** For styling the UI.
    
### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
•	A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
•	Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript if you want to customize the code.
    

#### Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-drawing-recognition.git cd ml-drawing-recognition

Open index.html in your browser.


## Usage
Open the app in your browser.
Use the canvas to draw a shape or object.
Wait for the prediction to appear below the canvas, along with a confidence score.


### Model Training and Integration
The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model for image recognition. You can train your own model using datasets like Quick, Draw! or any custom dataset.To integrate a new model:

Train the model using TensorFlow or a similar framework.
Export the model in a format compatible with TensorFlow.js.
Replace the existing model file and update the prediction logic in the JavaScript code.
